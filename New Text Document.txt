Project: Banking Data Platform (MinIO → Airflow → Snowflake) Status: ✅ SUCCESS / OPERATIONAL

1. Infrastructure

Docker: Airflow (Webserver, Scheduler, Triggerer, Postgres) and MinIO are healthy.

Network: Airflow connects to MinIO via http://minio:9000.

2. The Pipeline (banking_minio_to_snowflake_final)

Trigger: Manual or Scheduled.

Task 1 (download_minio): Downloads transactions.json from MinIO bucket banking-data.

Task 2 (load_snowflake): Uploads to Snowflake Stage and loads into BANKING_DB.BRONZE.TRANSACTIONS.

3. The Data Structure (Crucial Detail)

Format: JSON (CDC / Debezium format).

Schema: Data is nested inside an {"after": { ... }} object.

Current View: TRANSACTIONS_FLATTENED (Created in Snowflake) successfully extracts id, account_id, and created_at.

Pending Item: The amount column is Base64 encoded (e.g., "ASaP") and needs decoding in the Silver layer.
